  # Here we specify that boilers have a component
  # which is itself an object whose parent
  # is `water pump`
  components:
    - parent: water pump

  # Boilers have a property which most other appliances
  # do not have: a fuel source.  We specify additional
  # properties using the JSON Schema syntax.

      enum: [natural gas, coal, wood, oil, LPG]
      
  subtypes:

  # We can specify the different mechanisms that
  # control the boiler.  This is useful, for example,
  # if we want to find all appliances which 
  # must be manually controlled (e.g. toasters)
  control: [manual, timer, thermostat]

  # We can also declare prior knowledge about boilers.
  # For example, we know that boilers tend to be in
  # bathrooms, utility rooms or kitchens
