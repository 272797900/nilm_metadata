  # Here we specify that boilers have a component

  # Boilers have a property which most other appliances
  # do not have: a fuel source.  We specify additional

  # We can specify the different mechanisms that
  # control the boiler.  This is useful, for example,
  # if we want to find all appliances which 
  # must be manually controlled (e.g. toasters)
  control: [manual, timer, thermostat]

  # We can also declare prior knowledge about boilers.
  # For example, we know that boilers tend to be in
  # bathrooms, utility rooms or kitchens
