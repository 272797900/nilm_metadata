# The Idea:
The schema in the schema directory describes the complete schema for meters and
appliances.

To assemble this complete data per appliance/meter in-memory, we traverse
the following hierarchy.  i.e. if we find an appliance instance 
which is a subtype of "Refrigeration:Samsung:RSH7UNBP" then we first
follow the tree to the top.  Then, starting from the top, we form a set of
key:value pairs where subclasses override previous values (just use dict.update).


TODO:

* Move all information from schema/appliance_old.json to classes/appliance_classes.json
* Get it working with appliance_catalogue
* Do data for meters, using same pattern
* Test it out on HES
* Write my UKPD metadata
* Write docs
* Make it work with nilmtk



DONE:

* Build the code to traverse the class hierarchy
